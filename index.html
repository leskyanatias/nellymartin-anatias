                <p>I am a lecturer, a researcher, a (former) Fulbright scholar, a discourse analyst, a socio-cultural linguist, and a writer with more than fifteen years of professional experience who is passionate about teaching and meeting new people. I have taught in the tertiary level in Indonesia, the United States, and New Zealand since 2002. I enjoy observing how people in other cultures use their language and unpacking systems of social domination and marginalisation within any given society. I also love to jog, hike, travel abroad, and learn about different cultures.</p>
